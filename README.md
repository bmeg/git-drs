# Git DRS

## About

Built off [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/), Git DRS allows you to store file contents outside of the Git repo such as in a gen3 bucket, while keeping a pointer to the file inside the repo. With Git DRS, data files that are traditionally too large to store in Git can be tracked along with your code in a single Git repo! And the best part: you can still use the same Git commands you know (and possibly love)! Using just a few extra command line tools, Git DRS helps consolidate your data and code into a single location. 

## Basics

Git DRS functions within Git, so you will only need a few extra commands (`git-lfs pull`, `git-drs init`, etc) that aren't the usual Git commands to do this. Git DRS primarily plugs in the following ways:
- `git add`: during each add, Git LFS processes your file and checks in a pointer to git.
- `git commit`: before each commit, Git DRS creates a DRS object that stores the details of your file needed to push.
- `git push` / `git pull`: before each push, Git DRS handles the transfer of each committed file 
- `git pull`: Git DRS pulls from the DRS server to your working directory if it doesn't already exists locally

## Getting Started: Gen3 DRS Server

### Dependencies

1. Download [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) (`brew install git-lfs` for Mac users)
2. Configure LFS on your machine
    ```
    git lfs install --skip-smudge
    ```
3. Download credentials from your data commons
   1. Login to your data commons
   2. Click your email in the top right to go to your profile
   3. Click Create API Key -> Download JSON
   4. Make note of the path that it downloaded to
4. Download Git DRS
    ```
    # build git-drs from source w/ custom gen3-client dependency
    git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/bmeg/git-drs.git
    cd git-drs
    go build

    # make the executable accessible
    export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
    ```
5. Clone an existing DRS repo. If you don't already have one set up see "Setting up your repo"
    ```
    cd ..

    # clone test repo
    git clone git@source.ohsu.edu:CBDS/git-drs-test-repo.git
    cd git-drs-test-repo
    ```
6. Configure general acccess to your data commons
    ```
    git drs init --profile <data-commons-name> --apiendpoint https://data-commons-name.com/ --cred /path/to/downloaded/credentials.json
    ```

### Project Setup

When you do `git drs init`, there are a couple things already set up for you...
- `.drs` directory to automatically store any background files and logs needed during execution
- Git settings to sync up the git with gen3 services
- a gen3 profile is created for you so that you can access gen3

In your own repo, all you need to setup is a .drsconfig file. Once you have created a Git repo, create a `.drs/config` with the following structure

```
{
  "gen3Profile": "<gen3-profile-here>",
  "gen3Project": "<project-id-here>",
  "gen3Bucket": "<bucket-name-here>"
}
```
- `gen3Profile` stores the name of the profile you specified in `git drs init` (eg the  `<data-commons-name>` above)
- `project` is the project ID uniquely describing the data from your project. This will be provided to you by a data commons administrator
- `bucket` is the name of the bucket that you will be using to store all your files. This will also be provided by a data commons administrator


### Quick Start Commands

**Track Specific File Types**
Store all bam files as a pointer in the Git repo and store actual contents in the DRS server. This is handled by a configuration line in `.gitattributes`
```
git lfs track "*.bam"
git add .gitattributes
```

**Pull Files**
Pull a single file
```
git lfs pull -I /path/to/file
```
Pull all non-localized files
```
git lfs pull
```
