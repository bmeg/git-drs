If the user **doesn't have the SHA256 hash** of the remote file (which Git LFS requires for the pointer), but they do have an **MD5 hash** or **ETag** (common in object stores like S3), then you can implement a **two-stage mapping approach** in your Git LFS custom transfer agent.

---

## 🧠 Strategy: Use ETag or MD5 to Resolve to SHA256

> TODO -  🚧 this needs prototyping - completely untested 🚧

Instead of requiring the user to download the file, your system can:

### 🔹 1. **Store metadata keyed by ETag or MD5**
```json
{
  "etag": "abc123etag",
  "url": "https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.bam",
  "size": 1048576,
  "sha256": null
}
```

### 🔹 2. **During transfer (download/upload):**
- Use ETag to identify the file.
- At the **first transfer**, download the file, compute SHA256 once, and cache it.
- Store the mapping: `etag → sha256`
- Update the `.lfs-meta/<sha256>.json` so it can be reused.

---

## ✅ Workflow

### ⚙️ `git lfs track-remote` (No SHA256)

```bash
git lfs track-remote data/file.bam \
  --url https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.bam \
  --etag abc123etag \
  --size 1048576
```

1. Writes:
   - `data/file.bam` → Git LFS pointer file with **temporary SHA** (placeholder)
   - `.lfs-meta/etag/abc123etag.json` → URL + metadata

2. On `git lfs pull`:
   - Transfer agent:
     - Resolves `etag → url`
     - Downloads file
     - Calculates `sha256`
     - Rewrites `.git/lfs/objects/...` with correct SHA
     - Creates `.lfs-meta/<sha256>.json` for future use

3. Subsequent pulls/commits:
   - The SHA256 is known and directly used.

## 📁 Directory Layout

```
repo/
├── .lfs-meta/
│   ├── etag/
│   │   └── abc123etag.json  # early metadata keyed by ETag
│   └── sha256/
│       └── 6a7e3...json     # full metadata keyed by SHA once known
└── file.bam  # Git LFS pointer (eventually points to 6a7e3...)
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tips for Implementation

- Use ETag or MD5 **as a temporary key** until the SHA256 is known.
- Populate `.lfs-meta` with:
  - `etag → url`
  - `etag → sha256` (once resolved)
- Optional: warn user if size mismatches during transfer
- You can support `track-remote` with:
  ```bash
  --etag abc123etag
  --size 1048576
  ```

## 🔐 Cloud-Friendly Bonus

For object stores like AWS S3:
- `HEAD` requests return `ContentLength` and `ETag` — no download needed.
- You can cache remote metadata efficiently.

---
If the user wants to **mix standard Git LFS files** (stored in a Git LFS server or local LFS cache) with **custom “remote” LFS files** (tracked via metadata like ETag/URL), the best approach is to **register multiple transfer agents and selectively route files** to the right agent based on their OID or file path.

---

## 🧭 Strategy Overview

1. **Standard LFS files** are handled by the default `basic` agent.
2. **Remote-tracked files** are handled by your custom agent (e.g., `remote`), using metadata like ETag or MD5.
3. Use **OID prefixes** (e.g., `etag-abc123`) or filename patterns to differentiate.

---

## ✅ Use Custom OID Prefix (Recommended)

### 🔑 Idea:
When registering a remote file via `track-remote`, prefix its OID with `etag-<etag>` instead of a real SHA256. Your custom agent handles these, while standard files still use SHA-based OIDs.

### `.gitconfig`
```ini
[lfs.customtransfer]
    remote.path = python3 transfer_agent.py

[lfs]
    concurrenttransfers = 3
    tusTransferMaxRetries = 1
    transfer = remote,basic  # order matters
```

### In `transfer_agent.py`, match only `etag-*` OIDs:

```python
if cmd["event"] == "download" and cmd["operation"]["oid"].startswith("etag-"):
    ...
```

### Standard files (with SHA256 OIDs) bypass this agent and fall back to `basic`.

## 🔐 Hybrid Considerations

| Concern                | Standard LFS | Remote LFS (custom) |
|------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| SHA256 available       | Yes          | Optional (resolved on pull) |
| Pointer format         | Standard     | Compatible, but custom `oid` |
| Transfer storage       | Git LFS server | External (e.g., S3, HTTP) |
| Pull/Push supported    | Yes          | Yes (via agent) |
| Integrity verification | SHA256       | SHA256 (on first download) |

## 🚀 Summary

| Use Case                   | Solution                                      |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Mixed LFS file support     | Register multiple agents (`remote`, `basic`) |
| Route remote files         | Use `oid` prefix like `etag-*`                |
| Route standard files       | Leave `oid` as normal SHA256                 |
| Optional: path-based split | Use `.gitattributes` with multiple filters    |
