If the user **doesn't have the SHA256 hash** of the remote file (which Git LFS requires for the pointer), but they do have an **MD5 hash** or **ETag** (common in object stores like S3), then you can implement a **two-stage mapping approach** in your Git LFS custom transfer agent.

## 🔐 User-Friendly Bonus

For object stores like AWS S3:
- `HEAD` requests return `ContentLength` and `ETag` — no download needed.
- You can cache remote metadata efficiently.
- User should just have to specify the url and the system can retrieve


---

## 🧠 Strategy: Use ETag or MD5 to Resolve to SHA256

Instead of requiring the user to download the file, the system can:

### 🔹 1. **Store metadata keyed by ETag or MD5**
```json
{
  "etag": "abc123etag",
  "url": "https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.bam",
  "size": 1048576,
  "sha256": null
}
```

### 🔹 2. **During transfer (download/upload):**
- Use ETag to identify the file.
- At the **first transfer**, download the file, compute SHA256 once, and cache it.
- Store the mapping: `etag → sha256`
- Update the `.lfs-meta/<sha256>.json` so it can be reused.

## ✅ Workflow

### ⚙️ `git lfs track-remote` (No SHA256)

```bash
# user has attributes and specifies a local path
git lfs track-remote data/file.bam \
  --url https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.bam \
  --etag abc123etag \
  --size 1048576

# user simply specifies a remote path
git lfs track-remote --url https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.bam 
# system HEADs url and retrieves:
# path = file.bam
# etag abc123etag
# size 1048576
# TODO: specify where AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_DEFAULT_REGION are set

# user specifies path and remote path 
git lfs track-remote my-directory/my-name.bam --url https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.bam 

```

1. Writes:
   - `data/file.bam` → Git LFS pointer file with **temporary SHA** (placeholder)
   - `.lfs-meta/etag/abc123etag.json` → URL + metadata

2. On `git lfs pull`:
   - Transfer agent:
     - Resolves `etag → url`
     - Downloads file
     - Calculates `sha256`
     - Rewrites `.git/lfs/objects/...` with correct SHA
     - Creates `.lfs-meta/<sha256>.json` for future use

3. Subsequent pulls/commits:
   - If the file is intended to be stored in one of "our" buckets:The SHA256 is known and directly used.
   - Otherwise, the transfer agent can still use the ETag to identify the file.

## 📁 Directory Layout

```
repo/
├── .lfs-meta/
│   ├── etag/
│   │   └── abc123etag.json  # early metadata keyed by ETag
│   └── sha256/
│       └── 6a7e3...json     # full metadata keyed by SHA once known
└── file.bam  # Git LFS pointer (eventually points to 6a7e3...)
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tips for Implementation

- Use ETag or MD5 **as a temporary key** until the SHA256 is known.
- Populate `.lfs-meta` with:
  - `etag → url`
  - `etag → sha256` (once resolved)
- Optional: warn user if size mismatches during transfer
